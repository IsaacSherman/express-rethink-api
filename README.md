# vagrant-express-rethink
Easy provisioning to get your next Vagrant + Node.js Express.js + RethinkDB project up and going.

## Note
RethinkDB's administration panel typically runs on port 8080. However, HTTP proxies typically use 8080, and so we've configured RethinkDB's admin panel to run on port 9090.
